Loop machine built with React.

Created a page with 9 rows, each row is a channel representing an audio loop.

Each channel can be muted with a toggle button.

A section in the bottom of the page with three buttons:

Play button – start playing all channels simultaneously (which isn’t muted).

Stop button – stop all playing channels and go back to the start.

Loop button (which can be toggled on and off) - when active, play in loops.
